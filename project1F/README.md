Project 1F
==========

This program produces 1000 images from rotating the camera around a 3D isosurface. Triangles are loaded from a VTK file and are transformed to camera space. Lighting and Phong shading are applied to the triangles to produce the images. Frames 0, 250, 500, and 750 are shown below.
